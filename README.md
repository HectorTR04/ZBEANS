Started as a project to implement AI assignments for a university course, adapted into a weekend gamejam between friends.
The gamejam version of the project can be found and played in the web browser or downloaded at https://hecticswede.itch.io/zbeans.
After the gamejam is completed the rest of the AI assignments will be implemented into the project and exisiting functionality will be polished further.
